# KYRO — Smart billing for every business

VAT-compliant invoicing, inventory, and customer credit for businesses in the UAE.

## Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth)
- TanStack Query, react-hook-form + zod
- @react-pdf/renderer, Recharts, lucide-react

## Setup

### 1. Install

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Fill in Supabase keys in `.env.local`.

### 2. Supabase

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Run the SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` in order in the SQL Editor: `037_vat_gcc.sql`, `038_every_business_email.sql`, `039_security_hardening.sql`, then `041_kyro_features.sql`. (There is no 040: an early draft was withdrawn. If you ran it, it is harmless.)
3. **Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Email**: keep email/password on and turn **Confirm email** on. New owners get a confirmation link and their business is created when they come back.
4. **Authentication → URL Configuration**: set the Site URL to your live address and add `https://<your-domain>/auth/callback` to the redirect URLs (used by sign-up confirmation and password reset).
5. **Authentication → Emails → SMTP**: Supabase's built-in sender only allows a few emails an hour. Connect your own SMTP (for example Resend) before real customers sign up.
6. Sign up through the app; each signup creates its own organization.
7. In **Settings**, enter your TRN, emirate, address, and IBAN — these print on every tax invoice.

### 3. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and sign in.

### 4. Deploy

- **Vercel**: import the repo, set the same env vars, deploy.
- Point production URL in Supabase Auth → URL configuration.
- Go through the deployment checklist in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Roles

| Role  | Capabilities |
|-------|----------------|
| Admin | Full access: products delete, users, settings, void invoices, stock adjustments |
| Staff | Create invoices, stock in/out, customers, view catalog — cannot manage users or void without admin |
| Accountant | Sees and exports everything, changes nothing (enforced in the database) |

## Invoice numbers

Format: `KY/2026/0001` (prefix + calendar year + sequence), the UAE standard. Businesses that issued invoices before migration 041 keep their April-March series (`KY/2026-27/0001`); either can be chosen in Settings → Invoice options. Existing businesses keep the prefix they already use. Sequences never reuse numbers even if an invoice is voided.

## VAT

Country rules live in `src/lib/vat/countries.ts` (UAE enabled; Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman staged). The engine is `src/lib/vat.ts`.

- UAE standard rate 5%; each product is **standard**, **zero-rated** or **exempt**
- Prices can be entered exclusive or inclusive of VAT (org default in Settings, toggle per invoice)
- VAT is rounded per line to 2 decimals (fils); no rounding to whole dirhams
- Tax invoices show supplier and customer TRN, VAT per line, and a VAT summary by rate
- Reports → **VAT Return (VAT 201)**: standard-rated supplies by emirate, zero-rated, exempt, input VAT from purchases, net payable — exported to Excel

Invoices issued before the VAT switch keep their stored GST amounts and are stamped `INR`; they still display in rupees and are excluded from AED VAT returns.

Run the checks:

```bash
npx tsx src/lib/vat.test.ts
```

```bash
npx tsx src/lib/vat-reports.test.ts
```

```bash
npx tsx src/lib/insights.test.ts
```

## Every kind of business

16 trades are built in (`src/lib/business-types.ts`): grocery, fruit & vegetables, restaurants, mobile shops, pharmacies, clothing, perfumes, hardware & building materials, furniture & appliances, auto parts, wholesale, salons, freelancers, jewellery, hotels and a general mode. Each one brings:

- **Units** (`src/lib/units.ts`): kg, g, L, ml, m, sq m, box, carton, bunch, hour, night… Weight, volume and length units take decimal quantities (1.25 kg); pieces stay whole. Stock moves by the same amount.
- **Categories with subcategories**: a built-in tree per trade plus the shop's own (`product_categories` table, Products → Categories).
- **Invoice line fields** where they matter: IMEI/serial numbers, batches, vehicle plates, sizes, room nights.

## Email invoices

Invoices (one, many at once, or payment reminders) are emailed with the PDF attached and a secure download link. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` (a domain verified in [Resend](https://resend.com)) to send in one click; without them, Email opens the user's own mail app with the PDF link. Every send is logged in `invoice_emails`.

## Invoices in Arabic, receipts, recurring invoices

- **English + Arabic tax invoices**: Settings → Invoice options. Every label gets its Arabic line and your Arabic business name is printed under the English one. Arabic customer and product names work in either mode (font: IBM Plex Sans Arabic, self-hosted in `public/fonts/pdf`).
- **Thermal receipts**: Receipt on any invoice opens an 80 mm / 58 mm print layout for POS printers.
- **Camera barcode scanning**: Camera in the invoice form scans EAN/UPC/Code 128/QR codes. Uses the browser's own detector, or the bundled zxing engine (copied to `public/scanner` on install).
- **Recurring invoices**: Repeat on any invoice bills the same customer weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly. Due invoices appear on the dashboard and are created with one tap (catching up on any missed dates).
- **Pay online link**: add your own Stripe / PayTabs / bank payment page in Settings; it is printed on invoices and shown as a button in invoice emails.
- **Your data**: Settings → Your data downloads everything as one Excel workbook, and lets the owner request account closure (requests are listed with `select id, name, email, deletion_requested_at from organizations where deletion_requested_at is not null`).

## Tests

```bash
npm run check
```

Runs the type check, lint, unit tests (`npm test`) and the database suite (`npm run test:db`, every migration on an in-memory Postgres plus security, numbering, plan-limit, accountant and recurring checks). GitHub Actions runs the same on every push, plus a production build.

## Monitoring

Crashes are logged to Vercel → Logs: browser errors as `[client-error]`, server errors as `[server-error]`, each one JSON line.
