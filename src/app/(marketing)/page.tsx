  {
    q: "Will it work for my kind of business?",
    a: `Almost certainly. ${APP_NAME} has 16 trades built in - fruit & vegetables, grocery, restaurants, hardware & building materials, furniture & appliances, perfumes, auto parts, wholesale, pharmacy, mobile shops, clothing, salons, jewellery, hotels, freelancers and a general mode. Each brings its own units (kg, litres, metres, boxes, hours…), categories with subcategories and invoice fields.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Can I sell by weight, like 1.25 kg?",
    a: "Yes. Quantities follow the unit you sell in: kilos, grams and litres take decimals, while pieces and boxes stay whole. Stock moves by the same amount, so 1.25 kg sold is 1.25 kg off the shelf.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I email invoices to my customers?",
    a: "Yes - one at a time from the invoice page, many at once from the invoice list, or payment reminders to everyone who owes you. Each email carries the PDF tax invoice and a secure download link, and replies come straight to your business email.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which countries' tax rules does it follow?",
    a: "The UAE, Saudi Arabia (with the ZATCA QR code), Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait, the United Kingdom, all 27 EU countries and India (CGST, SGST and IGST). Each invoice carries your tax number, the customer's where they have one, tax per line and a summary by rate, in your currency. Reverse charge and exports are handled too. Always confirm the requirements for your own business with your accountant.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you file my VAT return for me?",
    a: `No. ${APP_NAME} prepares a return summary laid out like yours (UAE VAT 201, Saudi VAT return, UK 9-box, India GSTR-3B and more) plus an Excel workbook from your invoices and purchases. You or your accountant still file it.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data safe?",
    a: "Yes. Each business's data is fully isolated from other tenants, and the app is hosted on a secure cloud stack. You only see your own organization.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in the free trial?",
    a: "New accounts get a 14-day free trial with the Starter limits. No card required up front. Subscribe when you're ready to continue, and cancel anytime from Settings → Billing.",
